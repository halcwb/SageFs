# SageFs — VS Code Extension

A full-featured VS Code frontend for [SageFs](../Readme.md) — the live F# development server. Inline eval results, real-time diagnostics, live unit testing with pass/fail markers, hot reload controls, session management, and a built-in dashboard — all powered by the running SageFs daemon.

> **Note:** This extension is not yet published on the VS Marketplace. See [Installing](#installing) below.

## Features

### Code Evaluation
- **Alt+Enter** — Evaluate the current selection or `;;`-delimited code block. Results appear as inline decorations.
- **Alt+Shift+Enter** — Evaluate the entire file
- **CodeLens** — Clickable "▶ Eval" buttons above every `;;` block

### Live Unit Testing
- **Inline test decorations** — ✓/✗/● markers on test lines, updated in real-time via SSE
- **Native Test Explorer** — Tests appear in VS Code's built-in Test Explorer via a `TestController` adapter
- **Test result CodeLens** — "✓ Passed" / "✗ Failed" above every test function
- **Failure diagnostics** — Failed tests appear as native VS Code squiggles
- **Test policy controls** — Enable/disable live testing, run all tests, or configure run policies from the command palette
- **Call graph viewer** — Visualize test dependency graphs
- **Test trace** — Browse three-speed test cycle events

### Live Diagnostics
- F# type errors and warnings stream in via SSE as you edit, appearing as native VS Code squiggles

### Hot Reload
- **Hot Reload sidebar** — Tree view in the activity bar showing all project files with per-file and per-directory watch toggles
- Toggle individual files, directories, or watch/unwatch everything at once

### Session Management
- **Session Context sidebar** — Loaded assemblies, opened namespaces, failed opens, warmup details
- **Multi-session** — Create, switch, and manage multiple sessions from the command palette

### More
- **Type Explorer sidebar** — Browse .NET types and namespaces interactively from the activity bar
- **Event history** — Browse recent pipeline events via QuickPick
- **Dashboard webview** — Open the SageFs dashboard directly inside VS Code
- **Status bar** — Active project, eval count, supervised status, restart count. Click to open dashboard.
- **Auto-start** — Detects `.fsproj`/`.sln`/`.slnx` files and offers to start SageFs automatically
- **Ionide integration** — Hijacks Ionide's `FSI: Send Selection` commands so Alt+Enter routes through SageFs
- **7 custom theme colors** — Inline result colors respect your VS Code theme

## Requirements

- [SageFs](../Readme.md) installed as a .NET global tool (`dotnet tool install --global SageFs`)
- An F# project (`.fsproj` or `.sln`) in your workspace

## Installing

> The SageFs VS Code extension is **not published on the VS Marketplace** yet. Install manually:

**Option A: Download from GitHub Releases (recommended)**

Each [GitHub Release](https://github.com/WillEhrendreich/SageFs/releases) includes a `.vsix` file:

```bash

```

**Option B: Build from source**

```bash
cd sagefs-vscode
npm install
npm run compile
npx @vscode/vsce package
code --install-extension sagefs-*.vsix
```

## Getting Started

1. Install SageFs: `dotnet tool install --global SageFs`
2. Open an F# project in VS Code
3. The extension will offer to start SageFs if it's not running
4. Press **Alt+Enter** on any F# code to evaluate it
5. Open the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and type "SageFs" to discover all commands

## Troubleshooting

**"SageFs: offline" in status bar** — The daemon isn't running. Click the status bar or run "SageFs: Start Daemon" from the command palette.

**"No .fsproj or .sln found"** — Open a folder containing an F# project. The extension auto-detects projects; set `sagefs.projectPath` for non-standard layouts.

**Inline results not appearing** — Make sure the daemon is running (status bar shows ⚡). Try "SageFs: Clear Inline Results" then re-evaluate.

**Test decorations not showing** — Enable live testing via "SageFs: Enable Live Testing". Check the Output panel (select "SageFs") for errors.

## Architecture

This extension is written entirely in F# using [Fable](https://fable.io/) — no TypeScript. The F# source compiles to JavaScript, giving you type-safe extension code with the same language as your project.

## Development

```bash
cd sagefs-vscode
npm install
npm run compile
```

Press **F5** in VS Code to launch the Extension Development Host.
